We are contacting the CFPB as a result of the highly irregular practices, notices and policies. \\n\\nTo have submitted a contract with addenda that clearly indicated that our realtor was giving us a credit against the purchase and to be pushed to close, even though there was no CD delivered in a timely manner. We were suppose to know before what we owed, we are entitled and they are required to provide me with a complete breakdown at least 3 days before closing so we could have knowledge of the funds we needed to bring to the table and what our costs and expenses were suppose to be. The fact that the loan officer said to us verbally \" send more and the difference will be reimbursed \\'\\' indicates that he knew that we would not be afforded the credit based on underwriting issues that were not clarified to us. Also, the fact that Chase did not move timely while were in escrow and not subject to default - to finalize our file so we would be approved was wrong. The fact that the title company had to continuously call/email our loan officer to get information and they took it upon themselves to provide what they thought was needed to avoid delay is not right. ( Escrow notified Chase over 30 days before we were set to close that we had too many credits. Chase never informed us of this, in fact they called us the day of closing, with a 3 hour notice, to tell us we had too many credits. Then forced us to sign the contract to not lose our locked-in rate and not giving us enough time to find ways to use all of our credits. ) They also, violated the Federal Fair Housing Act as they acted on a stereotype, delaying our mortgage application as they found out the buyers were expecting. They called us and told us \" you did n\\'t tell me you were XXXX \\'\\' As if that would be an issue. Upon hearing of the news, Chase only made the female buyer prove she was returning to work after XXXX the child. Women should n\\'t have to choose between buying a home and exercising their right to have a family. They never requested the male to provide any proof even though both of us were on leave. In fact, we had to cut the paternity leave short by 6 weeks, in fear Chase would deny us the loan. Even though the male was never questioned to prove he would return to work or even assumed he would take a leave, as they were being sexist. They made assumptions. They acted very poorly in this manner. Nor did they listen to our pleas, when we stated the Female had XXXX ( plus paid family leave ) approved along with her company supplementing her full paycheck. We were forced to notify our job of our situation which is an uncomfortable place to be as not all employees like to tell their jobs of their personal matters, as it can place someone at a disadvantage for getting a raise. \\n\\nLastly, Chase acted against internal rules set in place by Chase, to communicate with buyers via company email and company phones. As those calls are all recorded. Our loan officer only made phone calls to us via his cell phone leaving us with no paper trail to further prove our point and to hide his unscrupulous behavior.',\n",
       "  'Vendor : AMAZON/CHASE On XX/XX/2020 I purchase a wrist watch by {$64.00} plus handling, shipping tax which amounted to {$78.00}.

I was satisfied knowing that my AMAZON/CHASE account was refunded. \\nOn XX/XX/2020 I received a letter from CHASE informing that a charge back for the same amount {$78.00} was made due that A GIFT CARD WAS ISSUED for said amount and that I used it for other purchases. ( per today XX/XX/2020 phone conversation I was informed that I used said GIFT CARD to make 3 purchases and was given the items I bought which looks they in fact were purchased. \\nTHE PROBLEM IS : that Amazon used to gives reward points in the purchases customers made and I though that the credit I received in the 3 purchases was for the POINTS and not for a GIFT CARD they said they issued since I ignored and was not informed of such gift cards. ( See attachment that shows a REFUND was made NOT A GIFT CARD. \\nSUMMARY : Amazon should NOT ISSUED gift cards for returns but REFUND the value to whatever method of payment was used since gift card OBLIGE customer to continue purchasing.

I was unable to get the money in my bank account so I cancelled payment online on XXXX/XXXX/16. I received email confirmation of the cancellation. However, on XXXX/XXXX/16, my bank showed NSF fee for {$28.00} due to Chase crediting my bank account {$100.00}. I contacted Chase and they said they had no record of my cancellation. After many \" secure messages \\'\\', a few phone calls, and having screenshots of my bank statement, cancellation page from Chase.com, and the cancellation confirmation email, they were persuaded I had indeed cancelled that payment of {$100.00} ( which I made two days later ) and that I was due {$28.00} for the NSF fee. COMPLAINT # 1 : When speaking to Chase, they refused to send the {$28.00} back to my bank which I had to pay. Instead they insisted it had to be put on my CC balance. The lady stated \" it still goes back to you \\'\\'. On the contrary, they closed my CC and I do not have access to it. They put it on my CC balance, but it did not go toward my next balance due date either. I WANT MY MONEY BACK IN MY POCKET OR BANK ACCOUNT! COMPLAINT # 2 : After looking through my bank records and seeing payments to Chase, my credit report, and the fact I had to prove I canceled a payment, I would like to call into question the security of Chase \\'s website : electronic payments, personal info., credit reporting, etc. I dispute ALL information Chase has reported to all XXXX credit bureaus and would like CFPB support. If Chase can lose one cancelled payment and claim it has NO RECORD AT ALL, it is reasonable to say that other information could be missing and/or could have been mishandled that is negatively effecting my credit report at this time. In addition, I am questioning my balance due and other charges that have been placed on my CC. Since Chase has closed my account, I would like CFPB support to clear my credit report of any record with Chase and push for a balance due of {$0.00}. My records indicate that the balance is not even half of what Chase states it is now. In conclusion, my complaints are directly from Chase \\'s incompetency in quality assurance, customer support, and customer/website security. I would appreciate your help in this matter, thank you.',\n",

A few weeks later we receive a letter from Chase telling us our account is delinquent. That XXXX of the checks, my check from my XXXX account, was an ISF check. I knew that was a lie because I had the funds to cover my check plus {$6000.00} worth of overdraft protection. More than enough to cover a {$770.00} check. I started to investigate and saw that our mortgage account was credited for the full payment on XXXX XXXX 2015, and then 6 days later it was reversed and labeled a \" Misapplied Payment. My wife noticed her check cleared her account but my check was never presented to XXXX for processing. I called the Chase help desk and explained that my check was not an ISF check and asked where my check was. No one could tell me. They also said an investigation can take three weeks. I asked to speak with Supervisors and went through XXXX individuals, the last of which changed the alibi from a ISF check to that XXXX refused to process the check. XXXX told me my check was never presented for processing. Still no sign of my check. Now Chase hit my credit report with a negative post as being Delinquent. My credit rating went down by XXXX points from an \" Excellent \\'\\' to a \" Good \\'\\' rating and all of this without any indication of what happened to my check that was handed to a teller at Chase branch in XXXX New York. Meanwhile Chase had my wife \\'s check of {$770.00} and did not credit our mortgage account with those funds. I finally reached an Assistant Vice President by the name of XXXX XXXX. Within an half hour she saw that it was a Bank error and told me the scanner at the branch was not able to read the numbers on the check accurately and the teller should have realized the problem right away. XXXX XXXX told me that Chase would reverse all negative postings to my credit report and that all I needed to da was provide Chase with another check, which I did on XXXX XXXX, 2015. \\nHow can a bank hit your credit report in a negative manner without even concluding an investigation? I have heard stories of people have major problems with correcting errors on their credit report, is Chase going to help me with this problem if it occurs. Chase should be fined due to their lack of professional behavior with this issue. Labeling my payment as an ISF entitled them to collect fees and this was the first excuse for the problem which turned out to be an error on the banks part. Up to this date, I still do not have my original check, copy or hard copy. Should I put a stop payment? Is Chase going to pay the fee for the stop payment?
